# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this list.

## Additions

Please submit a PR with:

- Repository link.
- Short description (what it does and why it matters).
- Which section it belongs in.
- Evidence of relevance to OpenClaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot.
- Linked issue (use the "Add Resource Request" template before opening the PR).

## Formatting Rules (Required)

- Keep entries in strict A-Z order within each section.
- Keep each entry to a single bullet line (no wrapped sub-bullets for descriptions).
- Use this format: `- [name](url) - short description. \`Tag\` \`Tag\``.
- Use tags from the README legend and keep tag order consistent.

## Commit and PR Conventions

- Use semantic commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`.
- Keep commit messages scoped and specific (example: `feat(readme): add memory plugin integrations`).
- PR title should also follow semantic format.
- Link the issue in your PR body (example: `Closes #123`).

## Quality Bar

Prefer projects that are:

- Directly relevant to OpenClaw ecosystem usage.
- Maintained (recent activity, responses, or updates).
- Practical (docs, examples, active users, or integrations).

## Cleanup

You can also submit PRs for:

- Dead links.
- Archived/unmaintained projects that should be removed.
- Better categorization.
